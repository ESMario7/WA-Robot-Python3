# WA-Robot-Python3
This project works with WhatsApp Web Application on Ubuntu. It will send messages and images to a list of contacts from a .csv file and keep track of every action the bot does. In order for it to work you'll need to use your phone for the QR code and you'll also need to import the list of contacts to your phone as well with Google Contacts.
